# 📊 Gas Turbine Emissions Analysis

This project provides a comprehensive **statistical analysis** of gas turbine emissions data to uncover hidden insights, improve operational efficiency, and ensure environmental compliance.

---

## 📁 Project Summary

We apply various statistical methods such as:

- **ANOVA**
- **Linear Regression**
- **T-tests**
- **Correlation Analysis**
- **Dimensionality Reduction (Spearman’s rho)**

to analyze CO and NOx emissions using a dataset from a **gas turbine in Turkey**.

## 📌 Dataset Overview

- Source: [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/)
- Time span: 2011–2015
- Features: 11 numeric sensor readings
- Target variables: **CO** and **NOx emissions**

---

## 🔍 Key Insights

- **AT (Ambient Temperature)** has a strong negative effect on NOx.
- **AP (Ambient Pressure)** positively affects NOx, but to a lesser extent.
- **KNN imputation** outperformed median for treating outliers.
- Variables like **TEY** and **CDP** were dropped for weak correlation with NOx.
